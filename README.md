# IP-Sweeper

<h2>Description</h2>
This Bash script checks if the user has provided an IP address as the first argument when executing the script. If no IP address is provided, it displays an error message indicating that an IP address is required and provides the correct syntax. However, if the user provides a valid IP address, the script proceeds to sweep through a range of IP addresses from 1 to 254, pinging each IP address to check if a device responds. If a device responds, it extracts the IP address from the response and displays it. This script is essentially an IP address scanning tool that identifies active devices within a specified IP range.
